\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Radial metallicity gradients in galaxies, defined as the change in metal abundance with galactocentric radius, offer vital insights into the processes that shape the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. While the decrease of metallicity with increasing Galactic center distance can be generally understood theoretically \citep{Larson1976, Tinsley1980, Chiosi1980} and is established observationally for our Milky Way as a barred spiral galaxy \citep{Searle1971, Janes1979, Twarog1997}, the specific shape still somewhat unclear. Regarding our Milky Way as the only galaxy for which we can resolve millions of stars, \citet{Chiappini2002} noted more than two decades ago: ``Over the past decade, different authors using different observational tools often came to contradictory views on both the shape, the magnitude and the evolution of the abundance gradients along the disk.'' In more recent years, both Galactic and extragalactic observations have vastly expanded our observational data - while theoretical work, such as cosmological simulations, have reached the resolution and ability to explore detailed spatial gradients in chemical space.

In particular, the \textit{Gaia} mission \citep{Gaia-Collaboration2016} has extended our observable horizon and thus provided new insights into the radial metallicity gradient. While \citet[][see their Fig. 6]{Hogg2019} created a first $20\,\mathrm{kpc}$-spanning metallicity map of the galaxy with APOGEE and \textit{Gaia} data. \citet{Zari2018, Zari2021, Poggio2021, Poggio2022} have mapped young stars in the extended Solar region, with \citet{Poggio2022} finding excess metallicity around spiral arms (see their Fig. 2) and \citet{Hackshaw2024} finding similar variations with APOGEE data. \citet{Imig2023} used the hundreds of thousands of stars observed by both \textit{Gaia} and APOGEE to trace gradients across different stellar populations and stellar ages. The latter is especially important, as we have understood that radial migration in the Milky Way can significantly shift the position of older stars with respect to their birth radii \citet{Binney2008, Frankel2018, Frankel2020}

Even before \textit{Gaia}, extensive observational efforts over the last decades have measured radial metallicity gradients using various stellar populations and gas tracers. In particular, \citet{Janes1979} delivered first evidence for a radial metallicity gradient in the Milky Way's disk of
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\mathrm{d{[Fe/H]}}}{\mathrm{d}R} = -0.05 \pm 0.01\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}},
\end{equation}
a value that is surprisingly close the the latest measurements\citep{Anders2017, Hayden2015}. With a larger sample, \citet{Twarog1980} noted that this relation is accompanied by a dispersion of $0.1-0.15\,\mathrm{dex}$ in [Fe/H]. Additional studies include references in Table 1 by \citet{Chiappini2001}, data from the RAVE and Geneva-Copenhagen Survey \citep{Boeche2013}, and results from APOGEE \citep{Anders2014, Cunha2016}. Studies using \textit{Gaia-ESO} \citep{Bergemann2014} found a gradient of $\Delta \mathrm{[Fe/H]} / \Delta R = -0.068 \pm 0.014 \mathrm{dex kpc^{-1}}$ close to the plane ($\vert Z \vert < 300\,\mathrm{pc}$). In addition to field stars, multiple studies use young open clusters as tracers \citep[e.g.][]{Cunha2016, Magrini2017, Casamiquela2019, Donor2020, Spina2021,Myers2022}, while others use young OB-type stars \citep{Zari2018, Zari2021, Poggio2021, Poggio2022} or Cepheids \citep{Andrievsky2002, Andrievsky2002b, Lemasle2007, Lemasle2013}. Using the latter Cepheids, \citet{Genovali2014} highlighted a large intrinsic dispersion and fine structure of the metallicity gradient, where ``residuals of the metallicity gradient are tightly correlated with candidate Cepheid groups''.

Several other challenges have been faced in the study of the Milky Way's metallicity gradients:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assessing the completeness of the observed dataset remains a difficult but fundamental task \citep{Bergemann2014}.
    \item Different samples often find different gradients, with steeper gradients reported by \citet{Bergemann2014, Boeche2013} compared to \citet{AllendePrieto2006, Hayden2014, Anders2014, Katz2011}. The observed gradients may reflect the limitations of small datasets or the larger vertical distances probed in some studies \citep{Bergemann2014}.
    \item We are not yet fully understanding spiral arm structures and their impacts on metallicity gradients \citep{Poggio2021, Poggio2022}.
    \item Similarly, we other effects like the Galactic warp may influence our measurements in complex ways \citep[e.g.][]{Lemasle2022}.
    \item On a more general note, the methodology of fitting a line to incomplete and scattered data should also be questioned. See e.g. \citet{Metha2021} for new ways to go beyond fitting basic linear regressions.
\end{itemize}

Understanding radial metallicity gradients across our Galaxy is equally essential for extragalactic studies. Observations of external galaxies, though often limited by spatial resolution and sensitivity, have employed techniques such as spectroscopy of HII regions, planetary nebulae, and integrated light to infer metallicity distributions \citep{Shaver1983, Vilchez1996, Rolleston2000, Bresolin2012, Sanchez2014}. Among the plethora of studies, recent examples include \citet{Sanchez2014} with CALIFA galaxies (see their Figs. 5 and 11), \citet{Mun2024} and \citet{Chen2024} with MAGPI on the effects of spiral arms. Notable is especially the scatter that \citet{Chen2023} found for the gas metallicity across galactic radius with TYPHOON observations (see their. Figs. 4-6).

From a modelling perspective, galactic chemical evolution models can both test understanding of radial metallicity gradients and make predictions beyond the limited volumes and tracers tested by Milky Way and extragalactic studies. Such galactic chemical evolution models include \citet{Chiappini2001, Minchev2014b, Kubryk2015, Stanghellini2015, Matteucci2001b}.

On an even larger scale, new suites of simulations now allow to test gradients across a larger range of simulated galaxies - including Milky Way analogues. While \citet{Pilkington2012} found that such gradients are established by inside-out formation in RaDES simulations, whereas \citet{Tissera2019} used EAGLE simulations to study gradients across different galaxy characteristics, such as mergers and stellar mass. \citet{Bellardini2021} and \citet{Bellardini2022, Graf2024} compared the radial metallicity gradient and its azimuthal scatter for different simulations of the FIRE suite for gas and stars, respectively. Focusing on the change of the radial metallicity gradient over time, \citet{Grand2015} assessed the scatter of radial metallicity distribution for different stellar ages. Both \citet[][see their Fig. 6]{Ma2017} with FIRE and \citet[see their Fig. 9][]{Agertz2021} with VINTERGATAN further assessed the evolution of the radial metallicity gradient for gas and stars. \citet{Khoperskov2023e} again focused on the gas and found the scatter of the gas metallicity of $\approx 0.04-0.06\,\mathrm{dex}$ at a given galactocentric distance.

Despite significant observational and theoretical advancements, several fundamental questions about radial metallicity gradients remain unanswered. This study aims to address four critical scientific hypotheses using a high-resolution simulation of a Milky Way analogue galaxy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Linearity of the gradient:} To what extent is the radial metallicity gradient linear? Alternatively, would it be better described by two linear relations, with a break radius at corotation radius \citep[][and references therein]{Bresolin2012} or further out \citep{Donor2020} or a more sophisticated function \citep[see e.g.][]{Chiappini2001, Kubryk2015}? Investigating the gradient's form helps in understanding the galactic processes influencing metallicity at different radii \citep{Minchev2014b}.
    \item \textit{Scatter in the gradient:} How much scatter in the radial metallicity gradient is expected based on simulations? Quantifying the scatter can provide insights into the effects of transient events like mergers, star formation bursts, and gas accretion.
    \item \textit{Coherence of the gradient with position:} How significant is the change in the radial metallicity gradient as a function of position, both in terms of radial coverage and azimuth? Understanding these variations can reveal the underlying processes affecting metallicity distribution, such as spiral arm dynamics and bar-driven mixing \citep[see their Figs. 5-8][]{DiMatteo2013}.
    \item \textit{Coherence of the gradient with age:} Until what stellar age can stars be used as reliable tracers of the gas disk in simulations, in terms of both chemical composition and position? This question is pivotal for interpreting observed gradients across different ages \citep[e.g.][]{Willett2023} and comparing them with model predictions, particularly concerning the migration and heating of stellar populations \citep{Binney2008, Frankel2018}.
\end{enumerate}

By addressing these hypotheses, we aim to deepen our understanding of the processes governing the distribution of metals in galaxies and their evolution over time. This study not only provides new insights into the Milky Way but also offers comparative perspectives for extragalactic research, contributing to a unified framework for studying galactic metallicity gradients.

The paper is structured as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:data} describes the data of GALAH observations and NIHAO simulations. Sec.~\ref{sec:radial_metallicity_gradients} analyses the radial metallicity gradients of the simulations. Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses to which extend these gradients are linear and what we can learn from the residuals. Sec.~\ref{sec:conc} concludes the paper.

\section{Data: Observations and simulations} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{Observational data from the GALAH Survey}\label{sec:obs_data}

% Observations are provided through the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. For our study, we use the abundance measurements from the third data release (DR3) of the GALAH Survey with its 588,571 stars \citep{Buder2021}. The main program of the survey targets nearby stars via their visual magnitudes (typically $9 < V < 12$ and $12 < V < 14$) while neglecting the Galactic plane ($\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$). However, the data release also includes auxiliary programs of the K2 and TESS footprints \citep{Sharma2018, Sharma2019} as well as open and globular clusters \cite[for more details see][]{Buder2021}. Stars were targeted with the 2dF fibre optics positioner system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope \citep{Heijmans2012, Farrell2014} and the light of up to 400 stars was simultaneously fed into the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph \citep[HERMES,][]{Barden2010, Sheinis2015}. HERMES delivers high-resolution ($R \sim 28,000$) spectra in four wavelength bands across the optical range which were reduced with the pipeline by \citep{Kos2017}.

% Stellar parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_\text{mic}$, $v_\text{broad}$, and $v_\text{rad}$) and abundances for up to 31\footnote{Li*, C*, O*, Na*, Mg*, Al*, Si*, K*, Ca*, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn*, Fe*, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba*, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, with * denoting elements calculated in 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), instead of 1D LTE.} different elements across multiple nucleosynthesis channels are estimated using a modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy \citep[\textsc{sme}][]{Valenti1996, Piskunov2017} and 1D \textsc{marcs} model atmospheres \citep{Gustafsson2008}. Eleven elements are computed in non-LTE \citep{Amarsi2020}, the others in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and additional constraints on the surface gravities are incorporated through inferred distances by \citet{BailerJones2021} and their limit on absolute magnitudes and luminosities.

% In addition to the chemical information, we use the crossmatches of stars with value-added-catalog for stellar ages. The latter incorporates photometric and astrometric information from \Gaia eDR3 \citep{Lindegren2021a} and 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} to estimate isochrone ages with the \textsc{bstep} code \citep{Sharma2018}.

% We apply the following general quality and selection cuts to the data, firstly $\texttt{flag\_repeat} = 0$ to get one measurement per star, and secondly $\texttt{flag\_sp} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_fe\_h} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_Mg\_fe} = 0$, $\texttt{snr\_c2\_iraf} > 25$, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -2$ to get the most reliable stellar parameters while maintaining a sufficient amount of stars. Whenever we use additional elemental abundances of an element X, we also enforce $\texttt{flag\_X\_fe} = 0$.

% While we have considered enforcing \textsc{bstep} age uncertainties below 50\%, we have decided against implementing a sharp limit, both to avoid complex influences\footnote{Of the \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr.tex} stars above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc}, \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above40perc_ageunc}, and \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above30perc_ageunc} have uncertainties above $50\%$, $40\%$, and $30\%$, respectively. Of the \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr.tex} stars below $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ already \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc.tex} have uncertainties above $50\%$.} in the selection function and because it does not significantly impact the stars with ages above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$.

% To allow better comparability with the simulations later on (see Sec.~\ref{sec:location}), we also limit our sample to stars with Galactic latitude $\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$ and distance $D_\varpi < 4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ \citep[based on photogeometric distances from][]{BailerJones2021}, the 95th distance percentile of GALAH DR3 \citep{Buder2021}. After applying all these cuts, our sample still consists of \input{tex_text/nr_stars_in_galah_after_cuts}stars, allowing a statistically meaningful comparison with theoretical predictions.

\subsection{Theoretical predictions from a NIHAO Zoom-in simulation}\label{sec:sim_data}

The model perspective on accretion is provided through a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue (\texttt{g8.26e11}) from the \textit{Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects} \citep[NIHAO,][]{Wang2015}. The model galaxy has a total mass (gas, stars and dark matter) of $8.26 \cdot 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and contains $4 \cdot 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass with a stellar mass resolution of $1.06 \cdot 10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Buck2021} and was calculated as part of the NIHAO-UHD project \citep{Buck2020b}.

\subsubsection{How simulations were carried out}

% Simulations were carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{Gasoline2} \citep{Wadsley2017} using cosmological parameters from \citet{Planck2014} with initial conditions and energetic feedback descriptions from the NIHAO project \citep{Wang2015}. Zoom-in simulations were then performed as described in detail by \citet{Buck2021} with star formation following \citet{Stinson2006} and energetic feedback following \citet{Stinson2013}.

% Because computational resources still limit the mass resolution of simulations, we are relying on tracer particles that represent simple stellar populations (SSPs) with the same age, overall metallicity and discrete initial mass function (IMF). \citet{Buck2021} have implemented the flexible chemical evolution code \textsc{chempy} \citep{Rybizki2017} to calculate the chemical yields for the SSPs. In particular, we use the alternative (\texttt{alt}) setup of \textsc{chempy} that assumes a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF with high-mass slope of $\alpha_\text{IMF} = -2.3$ over a mass range of $0.1-100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for SSPs across a metallicity range of $Z/Z_\odot \in [10^{-5},2]$. The code calculates the contribution from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, CCSN across a mass range of $8-40\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and SNIa with a an exponential function with exponent $-1.12$, a delay time of $40\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and a normalization of the SNI rate of -2.9. For each of these nucleosynthetic channels, yields from the following studies are used: \citet{Limongi2018} for CCSN, \citet{Seitenzahl2013} for SNIa, and \citet{Karakas2016} for AGB stars.

% To achieve a roughly similar selection as the observational data (see Secs.~\ref{sec:obs_data} and \ref{sec:location}), while maintaining enough star particles, we limit the simulated data set to star particles within a torus at $8.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ galactocentric radius with a $4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ tube radius (corresponding to the 95th distance percentile of the GALAH sample) and neglect star particles within $\vert b \vert~<~10\,\mathrm{deg}$ or $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -2$. We use the last simulation snapshot at a cosmic time of $13.8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ to estimate the ages from the reported formation time.

% The simulation traces the elemental abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ba. Of these, ten correspond with the GALAH data and allow us to compare diagnostic plots possible with abundances of C, O, Mg, Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ba. To allow a better comparison of simulated to observed abundance patterns, we shift the abundance patterns [X/H] by the values listed in Table~\ref{tab:shift_4to5gyr}, such that the median abundance for [X/H] is Solar for the stars with ages of Solar age ($4-5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) in the GALAH-like footprint of the Milky Way analogue.

% The simulation records galactocentric Cartesian positions $(X,Y,Z)$ and velocities $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)$ for each particle, which we transform into a galactocentric Cylindrical coordinate frame via
% \begin{align}
%     R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \qquad &\& \qquad V_R = \frac{X*V_X + Y*V_Y}{R} \\
%     \phi = \arctan(X/Y) \qquad &\& \qquad V_\phi = \frac{-Y*V_X + X*V_Y}{R} \\
%     z = Z  \qquad &\& \qquad V_z = V_Z,
% \end{align}
% while using the \textsc{numpy} \textsc{arctan2} package.

\SB{Show the X-Y and R-z distribution -> This will be important when we select stars to make sure we select close to the galactic plane! Also compare with \citet{Poggio2022} on how they did it (if they applied a cut in $\vert z \vert$, maybe they only did an age cut?)!}

\subsection{Data selection}

Need to limit ourselves to young stars ($< 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$), to avoid too strong effects of radial migration \citep{Binney2008, Frankel2018}

Fig.~\ref{fig:linear_radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_in_angles}f shows impressively, that if you look at a rather narrow range of $R_\mathrm{gal}$, such as $7 < R_\mathrm{gal} < 13\,\mathrm{kpc}$, the radial metallicity gradient could actually look like it is damping towards larger radii. \SB{Is this possibly what is happening in local studies of our galaxy, where many researchers are actually fitting 2 linear gradients with a break radius?}

\SB{Actually one can see this effect even better in Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_in_angles}b,d,e,f,h and i!}

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

Comparison to \citet[][see their Fig. 10]{Minchev2014b}: They see significant decrease of stars towards larger radii (note to myself: their bins are not scatter, but number density in Fig. 10). How does this compare to our number densities?

All code and data to reproduce the analysis and figures can be accessed via \url{https://github.com/svenbuder/age_abundance_nihao_vs_galah}.

% The repository also includes the chemical and kinematic data of the simulated Milky Way analogue \texttt{g8.26e11} for last snapshot of the simulation for the observable footprint that were used for this study as well as the cleaned catalogue of GALAH DR3. All GALAH DR3 data is also published by \citet{Buder2021} and can be accessed publicly via \url{https://docs.datacentral.org.au/galah/dr3/overview/}. The full simulation data of \texttt{g8.26e11} can be obtained upon reasonable request from the authors. Currently the only limitation in making all data public is limited cloud space to host the data. We encourage interested readers to get in contact with the authors for full data access. Redshift zero snapshots from the original NIHAO-UHD simulations can be found here: \url{https://tobias-buck.de/\#sim_data}.

% If you are using either of these data to follow up on this research, remember to give appropriate credit to the researchers who created and curated either data set, that is, at least to \citet{Buder2021, Buder2022} and \citet{Buck2020b, Buck2021}.
