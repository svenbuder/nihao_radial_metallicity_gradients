The paper is structured as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:data} describes the data of GALAH observations and NIHAO simulations. Sec.~\ref{sec:comparison} performs an initial comparison of diagnostic plots, using different abundance planes. Sec.~\ref{sec:Age-abundance} considers how stellar abundances of accreted and in-situ stars change over time, and quantifies the results. Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses our findings and their implications. Sec.~\ref{sec:conc} concludes the paper.

\section{Data: Observations and simulations} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{Observational data from the GALAH Survey}\label{sec:obs_data}

% Observations are provided through the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. For our study, we use the abundance measurements from the third data release (DR3) of the GALAH Survey with its 588,571 stars \citep{Buder2021}. The main program of the survey targets nearby stars via their visual magnitudes (typically $9 < V < 12$ and $12 < V < 14$) while neglecting the Galactic plane ($\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$). However, the data release also includes auxiliary programs of the K2 and TESS footprints \citep{Sharma2018, Sharma2019} as well as open and globular clusters \cite[for more details see][]{Buder2021}. Stars were targeted with the 2dF fibre optics positioner system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope \citep{Heijmans2012, Farrell2014} and the light of up to 400 stars was simultaneously fed into the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph \citep[HERMES,][]{Barden2010, Sheinis2015}. HERMES delivers high-resolution ($R \sim 28,000$) spectra in four wavelength bands across the optical range which were reduced with the pipeline by \citep{Kos2017}.

% Stellar parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_\text{mic}$, $v_\text{broad}$, and $v_\text{rad}$) and abundances for up to 31\footnote{Li*, C*, O*, Na*, Mg*, Al*, Si*, K*, Ca*, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn*, Fe*, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba*, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, with * denoting elements calculated in 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), instead of 1D LTE.} different elements across multiple nucleosynthesis channels are estimated using a modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy \citep[\textsc{sme}][]{Valenti1996, Piskunov2017} and 1D \textsc{marcs} model atmospheres \citep{Gustafsson2008}. Eleven elements are computed in non-LTE \citep{Amarsi2020}, the others in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and additional constraints on the surface gravities are incorporated through inferred distances by \citet{BailerJones2021} and their limit on absolute magnitudes and luminosities.

% In addition to the chemical information, we use the crossmatches of stars with value-added-catalog for stellar ages. The latter incorporates photometric and astrometric information from \Gaia eDR3 \citep{Lindegren2021a} and 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} to estimate isochrone ages with the \textsc{bstep} code \citep{Sharma2018}.

% We apply the following general quality and selection cuts to the data, firstly $\texttt{flag\_repeat} = 0$ to get one measurement per star, and secondly $\texttt{flag\_sp} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_fe\_h} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_Mg\_fe} = 0$, $\texttt{snr\_c2\_iraf} > 25$, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -2$ to get the most reliable stellar parameters while maintaining a sufficient amount of stars. Whenever we use additional elemental abundances of an element X, we also enforce $\texttt{flag\_X\_fe} = 0$.

% While we have considered enforcing \textsc{bstep} age uncertainties below 50\%, we have decided against implementing a sharp limit, both to avoid complex influences\footnote{Of the \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr.tex} stars above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc}, \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above40perc_ageunc}, and \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above30perc_ageunc} have uncertainties above $50\%$, $40\%$, and $30\%$, respectively. Of the \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr.tex} stars below $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ already \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc.tex} have uncertainties above $50\%$.} in the selection function and because it does not significantly impact the stars with ages above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$.

% To allow better comparability with the simulations later on (see Sec.~\ref{sec:location}), we also limit our sample to stars with Galactic latitude $\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$ and distance $D_\varpi < 4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ \citep[based on photogeometric distances from][]{BailerJones2021}, the 95th distance percentile of GALAH DR3 \citep{Buder2021}. After applying all these cuts, our sample still consists of \input{tex_text/nr_stars_in_galah_after_cuts}stars, allowing a statistically meaningful comparison with theoretical predictions.

\subsection{Theoretical predictions from a NIHAO Zoom-in simulation}\label{sec:sim_data}

The model perspective on accretion is provided through a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue (\texttt{g8.26e11}) from the \textit{Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects} \citep[NIHAO,][]{Wang2015}. The model galaxy has a total mass (gas, stars and dark matter) of $8.26 \cdot 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and contains $4 \cdot 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass with a stellar mass resolution of $1.06 \cdot 10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Buck2021} and was calculated as part of the NIHAO-UHD project \citep{Buck2020b}.

\subsubsection{How simulations were carried out}

% Simulations were carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{Gasoline2} \citep{Wadsley2017} using cosmological parameters from \citet{Planck2014} with initial conditions and energetic feedback descriptions from the NIHAO project \citep{Wang2015}. Zoom-in simulations were then performed as described in detail by \citet{Buck2021} with star formation following \citet{Stinson2006} and energetic feedback following \citet{Stinson2013}.

% Because computational resources still limit the mass resolution of simulations, we are relying on tracer particles that represent simple stellar populations (SSPs) with the same age, overall metallicity and discrete initial mass function (IMF). \citet{Buck2021} have implemented the flexible chemical evolution code \textsc{chempy} \citep{Rybizki2017} to calculate the chemical yields for the SSPs. In particular, we use the alternative (\texttt{alt}) setup of \textsc{chempy} that assumes a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF with high-mass slope of $\alpha_\text{IMF} = -2.3$ over a mass range of $0.1-100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for SSPs across a metallicity range of $Z/Z_\odot \in [10^{-5},2]$. The code calculates the contribution from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, CCSN across a mass range of $8-40\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and SNIa with a an exponential function with exponent $-1.12$, a delay time of $40\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and a normalization of the SNI rate of -2.9. For each of these nucleosynthetic channels, yields from the following studies are used: \citet{Limongi2018} for CCSN, \citet{Seitenzahl2013} for SNIa, and \citet{Karakas2016} for AGB stars.

% To achieve a roughly similar selection as the observational data (see Secs.~\ref{sec:obs_data} and \ref{sec:location}), while maintaining enough star particles, we limit the simulated data set to star particles within a torus at $8.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ galactocentric radius with a $4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ tube radius (corresponding to the 95th distance percentile of the GALAH sample) and neglect star particles within $\vert b \vert~<~10\,\mathrm{deg}$ or $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -2$. We use the last simulation snapshot at a cosmic time of $13.8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ to estimate the ages from the reported formation time.

% The simulation traces the elemental abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ba. Of these, ten correspond with the GALAH data and allow us to compare diagnostic plots possible with abundances of C, O, Mg, Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ba. To allow a better comparison of simulated to observed abundance patterns, we shift the abundance patterns [X/H] by the values listed in Table~\ref{tab:shift_4to5gyr}, such that the median abundance for [X/H] is Solar for the stars with ages of Solar age ($4-5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) in the GALAH-like footprint of the Milky Way analogue.

% The simulation records galactocentric Cartesian positions $(X,Y,Z)$ and velocities $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)$ for each particle, which we transform into a galactocentric Cylindrical coordinate frame via
% \begin{align}
%     R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \qquad &\& \qquad V_R = \frac{X*V_X + Y*V_Y}{R} \\
%     \phi = \arctan(X/Y) \qquad &\& \qquad V_\phi = \frac{-Y*V_X + X*V_Y}{R} \\
%     z = Z  \qquad &\& \qquad V_z = V_Z,
% \end{align}
% while using the \textsc{numpy} \textsc{arctan2} package.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

Comparison to \citet[][see their Fig. 10]{Minchev2014b}: They see significant decrease of stars towards larger radii (note to myself: their bins are not scatter, but number density in Fig. 10). How does this compare to our number densities?
