\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Radial metallicity gradients in galaxies, defined as the change in metal abundance with galactocentric radius, offer vital insights into the processes that shape the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. The decrease in metallicity with increasing distance from the Galactic center is well-established both theoretically \citep{Larson1976, Tinsley1980, Chiosi1980} and observationally in the Milky Way \citep{Searle1971, Janes1979, Twarog1997}. However, the specific shape and characteristics of this gradient remain somewhat unclear.

The Milky Way, being the only galaxy where we can resolve millions of stars, provides a unique opportunity to study these gradients in detail. Over two decades ago, \citet{Chiappini2002} highlighted the contradictions in the observed shape, magnitude, and evolution of abundance gradients. Recent advancements, such as the \textit{Gaia} mission \citep{Gaia-Collaboration2016}, have significantly expanded our observational data, allowing for more detailed studies of these gradients.

For instance, \citet{Hogg2019} created an extensive metallicity map of the Milky Way using APOGEE and \textit{Gaia} data, while \citet{Poggio2022} mapped young stars and found a metallicity excess around spiral arms \citep[see also][]{Zari2018, Zari2021, Poggio2021, Hackshaw2024}. Similarly, \citet[][among others]{Imig2023} traced gradients across different stellar populations and ages, emphasizing the importance of considering radial migration effects \citep{Binney2008, Frankel2018, Frankel2020}.

Historically, radial metallicity gradients have been measured using various stellar populations and gas tracers. Early evidence by \citet{Janes1979} suggested a gradient of
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d{[Fe/H]}}}{\mathrm{d}R} = -0.05 \pm 0.01,\mathrm{dex,kpc^{-1}}
\end{equation}
for the Milky Way which aligns with more recent measurements \citep{Anders2017, Hayden2015}. Estimated gradients also seem to be broadly consistent across different stellar tracers, such as young open clusters \citep[e.g.][]{Cunha2016, Magrini2017, Casamiquela2019, Donor2020, Spina2021,Myers2022}, young hot (OB-type) stars \citep{Zari2018, Zari2021, Poggio2021, Poggio2022}, field stars close to the Galactic plane \citep[e.g.][]{Bergemann2014} or Cepheids \citep{Andrievsky2002, Andrievsky2002b, Lemasle2007, Lemasle2013}. However, these gradients are accompanied by significant spread in [Fe/H] of $0.1-0.15\,\mathrm{dex}$, as noted by \citet{Twarog1980}, which may imply a fine structure of the metallicity gradient \citep[see][]{Genovali2014}.

Despite extensive observational efforts, several challenges persist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The completeness (or patchiness) of observed datasets remains a fundamental issue \citep{Bergemann2014}.
    \item How robustly can we use the incomplete data to predict substructure in the gradients, such as the need to actually fit two linear gradients with a break radius at corotation radius \citep[][and references therein]{Bresolin2012} or further out \citep{Donor2020} - or even more complicated functions \citep[see e.g.][]{Chiappini2001, Kubryk2015}?
    \item Different samples yield varying gradients, potentially due to biases in data or the inclusion of older stars \citep[e.g.][]{Boeche2013, AllendePrieto2006, Katz2011, Hayden2014, Anders2014, Vickers2021, Willett2023}.
    \item The impact of spiral arm structures \citep{Poggio2021}, the Galactic warp \citep{Lemasle2022} or bar-driven mixing \citep{DiMatteo2013} on metallicity gradients is not fully understood.
    \item Methodologies for fitting linear models to scattered data need re-evaluation \citep{Metha2021}.
\end{itemize}

Understanding these gradients in the Milky Way is also crucial for extragalactic studies, where spatial resolution limits observations. New instruments like the MUSE integral field spectrograph has enabled a plethora of extragalactic studies to contrast the Milky Way to and techniques like the spectroscopy of HII regions and planetary nebulae have helped to infer gas metallicity distributions in external galaxies \citep{Shaver1983, Vilchez1996, Rolleston2000, Bresolin2012}. Recent examples include \citet{Sanchez2014} with CALIFA galaxy observations as well as \citet{Mun2024} and \citet{Chen2024} who use MAGPI galaxy observations to probe for example the effects of spiral arms. Notable is also the scatter that \citet{Chen2023} found for the gas metallicity across galactic radius with TYPHOON observations (see their. Figs. 4-6).

From a modelling perspective, galactic chemical evolution models can both test understanding of radial metallicity gradients and make predictions beyond the limited volumes and tracers tested by Milky Way and extragalactic studies. Such galactic chemical evolution models include \citet{Chiappini2001, Minchev2014b, Kubryk2015, Stanghellini2015, Matteucci2001b}.

New suites of large-scale simulations now allow to gain insights into radial metallicity gradients across a range of simulated galaxies - including Milky Way analogues. While \citet{Pilkington2012} found that such gradients are established by inside-out formation in RaDES simulations, whereas \citet{Tissera2019} used EAGLE simulations to study gradients across different galaxy characteristics, such as mergers and stellar mass. \citet{Bellardini2021} and \citet{Bellardini2022, Graf2024} compared the radial metallicity gradient and its azimuthal scatter for different simulations of the FIRE suite for gas and stars, respectively. Focusing on the change of the radial metallicity gradient over time, \citet{Grand2015} assessed the scatter of radial metallicity distribution for different stellar ages. Both \citet[][see their Fig. 6]{Ma2017} with FIRE and \citet[see their Fig. 9][]{Agertz2021} with VINTERGATAN further assessed the evolution of the radial metallicity gradient for gas and stars. \citet{Khoperskov2023e} again focused on the gas and found the scatter of the gas metallicity of $\approx 0.04-0.06\,\mathrm{dex}$ at a given galactocentric distance.

This study aims to advance these theoretical insight by addressing four critical scientific questions using a high-resolution simulation of a Milky Way analogue galaxy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Linearity of the gradient:} Assess the extent to which the radial metallicity gradient of young stars is linear.
\item \textit{Scatter in the gradient:} Quantify the expected scatter in the radial metallicity gradient of young stars.
\item \textit{Coherence of the gradient with position:} Investigate the gradient's variation with radial coverage and azimuth.
\item \textit{Coherence of the gradient with age:} Determine the reliability of stars as tracers of the gas disk over different ages.
\end{enumerate}

The paper is structured as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:data} describes the data of our Milky Way analogue NIHAO simulation. Sec.~\ref{sec:radial_metallicity_gradients} analyses the radial metallicity gradients of the simulation under the four aforementioned questions. Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses them individually and Sec.~\ref{sec:conc} bundles them into an overarching conclusion.

\section{Data: NIHAO simulations} \label{sec:data}

The model perspective on accretion is provided through a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue (\texttt{g8.26e11}) from the \textit{Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects} \citep[NIHAO,][]{Wang2015}. The model galaxy has a total mass (gas, stars and dark matter) of $8.26 \cdot 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and contains $4 \cdot 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass with a stellar mass resolution of $1.06 \cdot 10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Buck2021} and was calculated as part of the NIHAO-UHD project \citep{Buck2020b}.

Simulations were carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{Gasoline2} \citep{Wadsley2017} using cosmological parameters from \citet{Planck2014} with initial conditions and energetic feedback descriptions from the NIHAO project \citep{Wang2015}. Zoom-in simulations were then performed as described in detail by \citet{Buck2021} with star formation following \citet{Stinson2006} and energetic feedback following \citet{Stinson2013}.

Because computational resources still limit the mass resolution of simulations, we are relying on tracer particles that represent simple stellar populations (SSPs) with the same age, overall metallicity and discrete initial mass function (IMF). \citet{Buck2021} have implemented the flexible chemical evolution code \textsc{chempy} \citep{Rybizki2017} to calculate the chemical yields for the SSPs. In particular, we use the alternative (\texttt{alt}) setup of \textsc{chempy} that assumes a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF with high-mass slope of $\alpha_\text{IMF} = -2.3$ over a mass range of $0.1-100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for SSPs across a metallicity range of $Z/Z_\odot \in [10^{-5},2]$. The code calculates the contribution from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, CCSN across a mass range of $8-40\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and SNIa with a an exponential function with exponent $-1.12$, a delay time of $40\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and a normalization of the SNI rate of -2.9. For each of these nucleosynthetic channels, yields from the following studies are used: \citet{Limongi2018} for CCSN, \citet{Seitenzahl2013} for SNIa, and \citet{Karakas2016} for AGB stars.

The simulation records galactocentric Cartesian positions $(X,Y,Z)$ and velocities $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)$ for each particle, which we transform into a galactocentric Cylindrical coordinate frame via
\begin{align}
    R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \qquad &\& \qquad V_R = \frac{X*V_X + Y*V_Y}{R} \\
    \phi = \arctan(X/Y) \qquad &\& \qquad V_\phi = \frac{-Y*V_X + X*V_Y}{R} \\
    z = Z  \qquad &\& \qquad V_z = V_Z,
\end{align}
while using the \textsc{numpy} \textsc{arctan2} package.

To achieve a roughly similar selection as the observational data of the Milky Way and avoid too strong effects of radial migration \citep{Binney2008, Frankel2018}, we restrict the simulation data to a galactocentric radius of $R_\mathrm{GC} \leq 20\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and further enforce stars to be younger than $1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. This selection de-facto also limits the vertical range of 99\% of stars to \include{tex_text/abs_z_young_within_r_max_99perc}.

\SB{Show the X-Y and R-z distribution -> This will be important when we select stars to make sure we select close to the galactic plane! Also compare with \citet{Poggio2022} on how they did it (if they applied a cut in $\vert z \vert$, maybe they only did an age cut?)!}

Fig.~\ref{fig:linear_radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_in_angles}f shows impressively, that if you look at a rather narrow range of $R_\mathrm{gal}$, such as $7 < R_\mathrm{gal} < 13\,\mathrm{kpc}$, the radial metallicity gradient could actually look like it is damping towards larger radii. \SB{Is this possibly what is happening in local studies of our galaxy, where many researchers are actually fitting 2 linear gradients with a break radius?}

\SB{Actually one can see this effect even better in Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_in_angles}b,d,e,f,h and i!}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

Comparison to \citet[][see their Fig. 10]{Minchev2014b}: They see significant decrease of stars towards larger radii (note to myself: their bins are not scatter, but number density in Fig. 10). How does this compare to our number densities?

\subsection{Linearity of the gradient} \label{sec:discussion_linearity}

To what extent is the radial metallicity gradient of young stars linear? Alternatively, would it be better described by two linear relations, with a break radius at corotation radius \citep[][and references therein]{Bresolin2012} or further out \citep{Donor2020} or a more sophisticated function \citep[see e.g.][]{Chiappini2001, Kubryk2015}? Investigating the gradient's form helps in understanding the galactic processes influencing metallicity at different radii \citep{Minchev2014b}.

\SB{Put some of these results into context of the Milky Way in Fig.~\ref{fig:radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_vs_nihao}.}

    \label{fig:radial_metallicity_gradients_mw_vs_nihao}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Scatter in the gradient} \label{sec:discussion_scatter}

How much scatter in the radial metallicity gradient of young stars is expected based on simulations? Quantifying the scatter can provide insights into the effects of transient events like mergers, star formation bursts, and gas accretion.

\SB{Put some of these results into context of the Milky Way in Fig.~\ref{fig:overdensities_mw_vs_nihao}, e.g. \citet{Poggio2021} and \citet{Hackshaw2024}.}

\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/overdensities_mw_vs_nihao.png}
    \caption{Caption}
    \label{fig:overdensities_mw_vs_nihao}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Coherence of the gradient with position} \label{sec:discussion_coherence_position}

How significant is the change in the radial metallicity of young stars gradient as a function of position, both in terms of radial coverage and azimuth? Understanding these variations can reveal the underlying processes affecting metallicity distribution, such as spiral arm dynamics and bar-driven mixing \citep[see their Figs. 5-8][]{DiMatteo2013}.

\subsection{Coherence of the gradient with age} \label{sec:discussion_coherence_age}

Until what stellar age can stars be used as reliable tracers of the gas disk in simulations, in terms of both chemical composition and position? This question is pivotal for interpreting observed gradients across different ages \citep[e.g.][]{Willett2023} and comparing them with model predictions, particularly concerning the migration and heating of stellar populations \citep{Binney2008, Frankel2018}.
